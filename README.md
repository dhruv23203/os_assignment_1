# Simple ELF Loader

## Description

This project implements a simple ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) loader in plain C. The loader parses a 32-bit ELF executable file and loads it into memory.
This implementation demonstrates the basic process of reading the ELF header, parsing the program header table, loading segments into memory, and transferring control to the entry point of the ELF file.
