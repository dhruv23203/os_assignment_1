Simple ELF Loader
Overview
This project presents a straightforward implementation of an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) loader, developed in C. The loader is designed to parse and load a 32-bit ELF executable file into memory. This implementation provides a clear demonstration of essential tasks, including reading the ELF header, interpreting the program header table, loading program segments into memory, and transferring control to the executable's entry point.
